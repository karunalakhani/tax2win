        Salary income refers to the compensation received by an employee from a
        current or former employer for the execution of services in connection
        with employment. Thus, income is taxable as salary under Section 15 only
        if an employer-employee relationship exists between the payer and payee.
        Salary income could be in any form such as gift, pension, gratuity,
        usual remuneration and so on.</p> <p> Meaning of Salary under Income Tax Act
